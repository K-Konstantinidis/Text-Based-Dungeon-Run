# Text-Based-Dungeon-Run
A Java project for a text based dungeon run

This is a Java project. After you run the Main class, then you will be able to play a dungeon run in the console.
There are 3 different classes (Warrior, Archer, Mage) and 4 different options for enemies to appear (Skeleton, Zombie, Assassin, Ancient Dragon).
Each character class, has its own buff. As an Archer there is a chance to deal more damage, as a Warrion there is a chance to take less damage
and as a Mage, there is a bigger chance to find healing potions.

For more information about how the code works, there are lots of comments in the .java files to help you understand everything!
